# Philosophy
I hate bloated pages and believe in pure html/css/js to run a vast majority of website. Most web pages have absolutely no excuse for being over 1MB, including huge libraries for no other purpose than t make the programmer's life easier on a few function calls. This project will always be as small as I can make it.
Currently, the only library I use is the awesome [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/), for the gapless audio loop, and do so out of absolute necessity.
