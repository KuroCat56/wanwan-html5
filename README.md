# wanwan-html5
This is an HTML5 version of the flash animation "WAN WAN INTENSIFIES.sfw". CSS animations controlled by pure Javascript for very fluid wolf girl.

# Why?
Wan not?

# Features
- Wan~
- Wolf girls!
- Dozens of wanning wolves, with search!
- Use any image you want and send it to friends!
- Mobile support
- No awoo :c

# Todo
- ~~Nightcore mode for fast wolf girl (that's easy just have to do it)~~
- ~~Mobile portrait fix (shoooould be easy)~~
- ~~Gapless audio loop so wolf girl can wan better (that's actually kind of hard for sync reasons)~~
- ~~Actual menu so we can have a LOT of wolf girls, a volume slider...~~
- ~~Vector graphics~~
- ~~Use url parameters for girls instead of function calls~~
- ~~Loading bar instead of Momiji~~
- ~~Better search~~
- ~~Volume slider~~
- Vectors for all girls: 2/29 done
- ~~Let people use custom url for wolf girl image~~
- ~~Customize volume slider so it's consistent across platforms~~
- Crazier Nightcore mode. I want to add more stuff but the problem here is mobile support - some mobile devices are already struggling to run the animation as is. I have to run some pretty strong optimization before I add *any* more stuff!
- [Get Down Nitori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkQaQZCzjic) mode
- ~~Replace wan images by text so we can write different stuff~~
- ~~Fix the animation unsync when page isn't visible~~
- ~~Rewrite of animation code, more below~~
- Awoo maybe.

# Philosophy
I hate bloated pages and believe in pure html/css/js to run a vast majority of websites. Most web pages have absolutely no excuse for being over 1MB, including huge libraries for no other purpose than to make the programmer's life easier on a few function calls. This project will always be as small as I can make it without compromising user experience.

Currently, the only library I use is the awesome [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/), for the gapless audio loop, and do so out of absolute necessity.
