# Philosophy
I hate bloated pages and believe in pure html/css/js to run a vast majority of website. Most web pages have absolutely no excuse for being over 1MB. This project will always be as small as I can make it, and it currently sits at ~330kB for the first load, with ~100kB more everytime you change character.

Currently, the only library I use is the awesome [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/), for the gapless audio loop, and do so out of absolute necessity.
